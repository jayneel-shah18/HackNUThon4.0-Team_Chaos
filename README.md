# HackNUThon4.0-Team_Chaos
This repository contains our implementation for 'Cyber Octet' track in HackNUThon 4.0
# Problem Statement
The project is designed to scrape websites on the dark web to detect malicious websites which encourage extremism and cyber terrorism.
# Methodology
We hacve implemented two options to detect malicious websites. In Automated Scrapping ,we can scrape the websites from the dark web which can be helpful in detection of malicious websites to a great extent. We started by making a dictionary of most common cyber terrorism related words. We then ask the user to enter the total number of malicious links they want. Our scrapper then goes to the dark web and selects a keyword from the automated dictionary and searches the dark web for these links and returns the most relevant links related to the keywords. In Manual Scrapping, we have also provided the option to user for selecting the keyword for which they want to detect the malicious sites. In this case, our algorithm goes to a particular site and tries to match the keywords related to cyber terrorism and extremism, if it is above a certain threshold then the site is flagged.
